1st Day of the new Windows Server OS Lab

- Installed Windows Server 2022 in Vmware PRO
- Setup'd the Windows Server Environment Graphically (faced issue with installation because I chose the 
non graphical environment)
- Changed Computer Name into "MMS-DC01" DC = Domain Controller
--> an Domain Controller is a server responsible for managing user data and authentification processes within
an network. For example if 100 people within an company have user accounts, they are stored within the DC. 
--> Setted up static ip, subnetmask, and dns
--> Checked if security updates are up-to-date
--> Added a new forest, Root domain name is: mms-testing.com
