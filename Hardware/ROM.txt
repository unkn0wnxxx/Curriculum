ROM (Read-Only-Memory) stores data which is not changable. It also stores this data 
permanently, without needing power. In most of the times the ROM is pre-coded and
holds Firmware & BIOS/UEFI. So it is very important for booting

Examples of ROM

- EEPROM --> only changable via electric --> for modern BIOS-Updates
- Flash-ROM --> Today's Standard --> for USB-Sticks, Smartphonestorage

Usages of ROM

-> Bootroutine of the PC: The BIOS/UEFI in the ROM initalizes the hardware.
-> Firmware: Controls embedded systems (for example Cars)
