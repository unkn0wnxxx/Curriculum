# TPM

---

TPM stands for Trusted Platform Module, which is a specialized chip on a computer's motherboard that provides hardware-based security functions.


## Key Features of TPM

Cryptographic Functions:

- Secure generation and storage of cryptographic keys
- Hardware-based encryption/decryption
- Hashing operations

## Security Benefits:

- Secure boot process verification
- Platform integrity measurement
- Protection against firmware attacks
- Secure credential storage

## TPM Versions

TPM 1.2: Introduced in 2003, provides basic security features
TPM 2.0: Released in 2014, more flexible with enhanced cryptographic capabilities

Discrete vs Firmware TPM: Discrete is a physical chip, firmware TPM (fTPM) is software-based but still secure

## Common Uses

- BitLocker encryption (Windows)
- Secure password storage
- Digital rights management (DRM)
- Platform authentication
- Secure email and disk encryption
- Windows Hello authentication

TPM technology is increasingly important for modern security requirements, especially with Windows 11 requiring TPM 2.0 as a minimum specification.
