# DDR (Double Data Rate)

DDR memory is a type of RAM that transfers data twice per clock cycle, making it faster
than older SDR (Single Data RAM).

DDR5 allows RAM to run at 3200-6400+ Speed, while requiring less voltage compared to DDR4

## Key Differences Between DDR Generations

- Speed & Bandwidth
- Voltage & Efficency
- Capacity - DDR5 supports much higher capacities per module
- Dual-Channel per Module - DDR5 splits each stick into two 32.bit channels (improve efficieny).

Important to note is that e.G DDR4 and DDR5 are not interchangable/compatible.
