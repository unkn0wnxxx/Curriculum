RAM (Random Access Memory) is the computer's short-term memory, which is way faster than
an SSD/HDD. The CPU takes all the data from the RAM and processes it.

Types of RAMS

- DRAM: Main System memory (DDR4/DDR5)
- SRAM: CPU Cache (L1/L2/L3)
- GDDR6: Graphic Cards (VRAM)

Why RAM Matters

- Multitasking: More RAM = More apps open smoothly
- Performance: Prevents sluggishness when switching tasks
- Gaming/Design: Critical for high-resolution assets

How it works

- CPU Requests Data → Checks RAM first
- RAM Delivers → If data is present (cache hit)
- If Missing → Slower fetch from SSD/HDD (cache miss
