## 32-bit Architecture (x86)

- is an outdated architecture, which defines how the CPU processes data, handles memory,
and executes instructions.
- It can process up to 32 bits of data per clock cycle,

## 64-bit Architecture (x64)

- is an extension of x86 by amd and intel.
- It can handle larger data chunks and is faster for complex tasks
- is run on all modern os and optimized for heavy tasks
